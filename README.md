Purpose
The ISVT websiteâ€™s mission is to support and promote the connection between the Iranian community in the university as well as developing Persian culture among the Virginia Tech Community. This website is designed to permit users to connect with one another so they can develop relationships in addition to sharing information, ideas, and messages. This interaction may arise in different ways, such as using discussion boards, registering and creating events, sharing pictures, posts and videos, etc.
